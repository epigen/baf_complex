# This project config file describes all *project-specific variables*
# Its primary purpose as as input to Looper, which will submit jobs as appropriate
# for each sample in the project.
# But it is also read by other tools, including:
# - project sample loop (primary purpose)
# - make_trackhubs scripts to produce web accessible results
# - stats summary scripts
# - analysis scripts requiring pointers to metadata, results, and other options.

metadata:
  # output_dir: the parent, shared space for this project where results will go
  output_dir: /scratch/lab_bock/shared/projects/baf_complex
  # results and submission subdirs are subdirectors directories under parent output_dir
  # results: where output sample folders will go
  # submission: where cluster submit scripts and log files will go
  results_subdir: data
  submission_subdir: submission
  # pipelines_dir: the directory where the Looper will find pipeline
  # scripts (and accompanying pipeline config files) for submission.

  # Relative paths are considered relative to this project config file.
  # Typically, this project config file is stored with the project metadata
  # sample_annotation: one-row-per-sample metadata

  # merge_table: input for samples with more than one input file
  merge_table: /scratch/lab_bock/shared/projects/baf_complex/metadata/merge_table.csv

data_sources:
  # specify the ABSOLUTE PATH of input files using variable path expressions
  # entries correspond to values in the data_source column in sample_annotation table
  # {variable} can be used to replace environment variables or other sample_annotation columns
  # If you use {variable} codes, you should quote the field so python can parse it.
